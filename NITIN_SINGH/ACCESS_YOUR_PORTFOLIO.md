- Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled (Step 1-3 above)
- Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling
- Check that `index.html` is in the root folder of your repository
- Verify branch name is "main" (not "master")

### "Site Still Building"
**Solution:**
- Wait 3-5 minutes (first build takes longer)
- Check the "Actions" tab in your repository
- Look for "pages build and deployment" with green checkmark

### "Can't See Pages Option"
**Solution:**
- Make sure you're the repository owner
- Repository must be public (or you need GitHub Pro for private repos)
- Check that you're in the Settings tab
