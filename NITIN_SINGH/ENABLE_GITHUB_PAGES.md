## Your Live URLs

After enabling Pages, your portfolio will be accessible at:

### Main Portfolio
```
https://NITIN-SINGH-2611.github.io/portfolio/
```

### Simple "Nitin" Link Page
```
https://NITIN-SINGH-2611.github.io/portfolio/nitin.html
```

2. Visit: https://NITIN-SINGH-2611.github.io/portfolio/
3. You should see your portfolio!

## Troubleshooting

### "404 - Page not found"
- Wait a few more minutes (first build can take 3-5 minutes)
- Check that you selected "main" branch
- Make sure your repository is public (or you have GitHub Pro)

### "Site not found"
- Verify repository name is exactly: `portfolio` (lowercase)
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
- Make sure you pushed the `index.html` file

### Links not working
- After enabling Pages, wait 2-3 minutes
- Clear your browser cache
- Try opening in incognito/private mode

## Automatic Updates

Once enabled, your site will automatically update whenever you:
- Push new changes to the `main` branch
- Update any files in your repository

No need to rebuild or reconfigure!

## Custom Domain (Optional)

You can use a custom domain later:
1. Go to Pages settings
2. Enter your domain in "Custom domain"
3. Configure DNS records as instructed
